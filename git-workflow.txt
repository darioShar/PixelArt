Create main repo

Clone locally. Pull to sync latest version form master to local. Or equivalently : git fetch (fetches all commit made) and git merge (merges all commits to a unique history of commands).
Create branch with git branch or/and move to branch with git checkout -b 
Edit code
git add to stage file for commit. git remove does not unstage but stages deletion
git commit to create record of changes made
git push to sync local changes to branch
Create pull request from head-branch to base-branch
